    <h2>About me </h2>
    <p>My professional experience and studies in architecture and engineering demonstrate my possession of resourcefulness, self-motivation, and a strong drive to achieve results. Over the course of my career in both corporate and medium-sized firms, I have consistently adapted my work approach to effectively address the specific needs and requirements of each job.

        I have a deep interest in BIM (Building Information Modeling) and Digital System Design in Construction, as well as other related fields. Initially, my passion was ignited by working with tools like Revit and Python, and later expanded to encompass web development. These tools have enabled me to discover efficient and streamlined solutions to complex problems. I firmly believe that teamwork and collaboration are essential for achieving goals, as exemplified by the focus of my thesis project. The objective of my thesis was to enhance collaboration among stakeholders through specific architectural activities, while also measuring ROI (Return on Investment) and implementing a system for monitoring progress. Additionally, during my master's studies, I investigated how life cycle assessments can be conducted using IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) data schema.
        
        As a result of my research and project experiences, I have developed expertise in data manipulation and the development of tools. With nearly a decade of experience in the construction industry, I strongly believe that continuous learning and development are crucial in order to stay aligned with the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
